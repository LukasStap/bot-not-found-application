# bot-not-found-application
his application has been made to help a Discord server with various misc. things using the Javacord API.

The classes You should check out are in the com/NeuroZap/GUI/Code/Applying folder. All of the code for the application mechanics is stored there.

Sorry if the code looks a tad bit messy, did not expect to show this to anyone but myself!
